# ShipBattle

Small project to get used to Java's syntax, data structures, project structure, etc.

Single player game like battleship. Choose a coordinate in a grid to shoot. You have a limited amount of bullets. You may hit water, ship, or loot. Your goal is to make as many points as possible with the bullets you have.

Currently available loots are a random amount of extra bullets, or extra points.
